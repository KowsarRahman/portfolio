						<h2>Who is Kowsar Rahman?</h2>
						<p>Kowsar Rahman Sadit is a third year Bachelor of Computer Science Student at RMIT University Australia. He is originally from Bangladesh. He developed an interest in the world of IT when he was studying in Year 8. That is when he started learning Web Programming. PHP was his first language. Now he can code in other languages like Java, Python and JavaScript. He sees himself as a full stack developer working in the industry. Fun fact about him is that he doesn't know how to swim! He is a Liverpool Fan. So if you are a Manchester United fan, then I hope you do well in the Europa League next season :p

										<h3>When did my interest start?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>My introduction with IT started when I started learning programming back in my Year 8. I picked PHP as at that time PHP was mainly used to make web applications unlike React these days. I thought if I oculd teach myself programming I could make those fancy websites and probably publish my first application on Play Store.</p>

										<h3>Why choose RMIT?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Choosing RMIT was completely based on research. I got offers from other universities as well but when I did an in-depth research on the course that I will be studying in my three-year studies, undoubtedly RMIT offered me the better content. I found that RMIT's course content were more relevant with the industry and were teaching me up-to-date technologies. Another reason was that RMIT had a whole course based on Cloud Computing which I have personally observed is highly in demand in the Australian IT Market.</p>

										<h3>What do I expect to learn?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I expect to learn about how the IT market works. Starting from the project planning to project delivery, I want to aquire how the process goes on and what are the challenges that I will have to deal with. For example how to work in a short staffed environemt or how to work with a tech stack that is completely alien to me.</p>

							<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
							<p>A full stack developer is a person who can take care of code from frontend till backend.</p>
							<p>They are neither specialised on frontend nor specialised on backend. They can create designs for a website and simultaneously create APIs for a microservice. Also, they take care of testing units too and finally takes responsible for deploying the software or website.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
							<p>It is appealing to me because I myself do not want to just only be the person in designing. My sixth sense will want to know how the backend behind this is working. Hence, I feel it apealing due to the fact that I can learn a lot out of it. Most importantly the industry needs a lot of full stack developer to fill the shortage and I feel I can be a part of it.</p>
							<p>
								For a person to become a full stack developer, one needs to pick up a frontend framework first. This could be React, Vue or Angular. Then after this comes the backend part. It could be Java, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc. For frontend testing, one needs to know about Jest or Enzyme. As for backend, it could be JUnit for Java. Then for continous integration, one needs to be aware of CircleCI or Jenkins. Finally to deploy the application, a person can choose either AWS, Azure or GCP. All 3 of them are popular and are highly demanded by employers.
							</p>
							<p>As of now I can code in React and have expertise in Spring Boot, Flask, etc. However I need to develop skills in Unit testing for both front and back end. I am also experience in AWS Cloud Computing however I plan to explore GCP and Azure as well.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
							<p>Simply learning one front end framework is not enough. That is the reaosn why am I planning to learn Angular and Vue.js. I rely on Youtube and LinkedIn learning to know more about them. These days, I am preparing myself to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner exam.</p>
							<p>The above photograph probably is a better description on what should be the responsibilities of a full stack developer.</p>

						<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
						<p>These are some of my personal profile tests and their results:<br /></p>
						
							<p><strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI):</strong> Architect</p>
							<p><strong>Big 5: </strong>Openness: 85  Conscientiousness: 63  Extraversion: 67 Agreeableness: 67  Neuroticism: 60</p>
						     
							<p>Being classified as an Architect gives me the confidence in designing and planning. However, I am not a fan of such internet tests. I believe there could be a lot of data entry mistakes while doing them and it entirely depends on honesty.</p>
